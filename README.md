## Installation

Follow these steps to get a development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Virtual Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    This command creates a virtual environment named `venv`.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    - On **Windows**:

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On **Unix or MacOS**:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment.

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
